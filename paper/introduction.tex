\subsection{Architecture}

The architecture of \tool has four main components.
The first is a core language to express temporal objectives
in the world.
The second is a semantic parser to map natural language
utterances to representations in the core language.
The third is a planner that, given a goal in the core language,
generates a plan for the robot to execute the goal if possible.
Finally, a visual user interface provides the user real-time
feedback by exhibiting the effect of a plan in a simulated environment.
