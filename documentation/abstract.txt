We present a human-robot communication system that allows for usage of unrestricted natural language and at the same time makes sure that a robot executes users' intention precisely.

We marry the two conflicting requirements by letting users "naturalize" an existing core programming language. Upon receiving an utterance, the system shows how the robot would behave. User can either accept the proposed behavior or rephrase the request (in terms of the unambiguous core language). In both cases the system learns: either it adds new language concepts or it strengthens the existing ones. Communication realized in this way has the following benefits: (1) It supports user-specific language idioms as well as learning the language concepts common across the general population. (2) It lets users define their commands in a modular way and reuse any parts in the future commands (3) It allows users to use the language concepts presumably defined by other users, while eliminating the danger of robot's unexpected behavior. In the case that the given command is unrealizable, the system provides the user with the explanation.

We are the first one to apply the concept of programming language naturalization to the robotic world. In our setup, the robot resides in a simple grid world with obstacles and items that it can pick, carry around and drop. We show that users develop naturalized concepts and adopt the ones developed by the others. Among the more complex concepts that the system was able to learn are spatial hierarchy (“field”, “room”, “floor”), spatial relations (“room to the left of the kitchen”) and rephrasing of logical descriptions (“pick all boxes except for the green ones”). Finally, we show that the system with a large enough number of users can be viewed as a complete natural language communication system (users that don’t know the underlying core language can use it) and that it outperforms the existing ones.
