This experiment is described in issue #41.


1.
- Get one green square 
- Visit any field containing both a yellow item and a circle-shaped item (may be the same item)
- Pick a yellow item from that space
- If possible, pick a square shaped item (from that space). Else, drop yellow item.


2.
 - Visit empty space
 - Put the items the robot currently holds to different empty spaces on the map
 - Visit any field containing both a triangle-shaped item and a green item (may be the same item) and pick only if these are two different items (one that is green, one that is triangular)
 
 
 
3.
 - Bring all items to room1 
 - Pick exactly 3 red items
 - Build a tower at any field consisting of exactly 2 red, 2 green and 2 blue items.
 
 
 4.
 - Get one red triangle
 - Collect all red items
 - Put all blue items in room3
 
 
5.
 - Put all red items in a line on the floor
 - Pick all green items. Drop all of them to empty places.
 - Make sure that every room has one red or blue item in it. 
 

6.
 - Bring all red items to a room that contains a yellow square
 - Make sure that there is no field that contains only yellow items, but not blue circles.


7.
 - Make sure that each room contains only items of a single color (you don't have to do it in a general way, step by step is ok)
 - Line up items in lines. Make sure that each color is lined up separately (you don't have to do it in a general way, step by step is ok)
 - If there are (at least) 5 items at room2, distribute them around rooms. Otherwise, bring all items (from the whole map) to room2.
